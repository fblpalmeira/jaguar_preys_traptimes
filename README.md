# Day 11 (11 April 2022) | Circular

We quantified the activity pattern and temporal overlap among the apex predator and large preys using the non-parametric analysis of Kernel density as proposed by Ridout and Linkie (2009). We extracted all hours (0000-2359h) recorded for each species on the photo-captures and converted them to the circular formart (0.1 to 1).   [(Palmeira and Trinca, unpublished data.]
